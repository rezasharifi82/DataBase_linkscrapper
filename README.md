# DataBase_linkscrapper
Simple selenium bot to extract all links that belongs to "Database" course.
--------
### What's that?
Once upon a time, one of my friends told me if i can collect all possible links which belongs to flipped classroom of Database course. That was too many links and it was an exhausting job to collect them manually.     
So, i've decided to automatize that process via Selenium. In that time, i hadn't been familiar with Selenium so i'd decided to learn it.    
After i'd become familiar with that technology, i designed this fascinating bot which can login to "Ferdowsi University of Mashhad" courseware (vu.um.ac.ir) automatically and find the database course.
> **but there was a problem**.



I needed to find those links which related to flipped classroom classes, not those extra-content videos which were not so usefull for my friend.
Hopefully, i've manged this problem normally and then extracted those links with a simple JS command.     

### Finally, It works like a clock :)
That was a sensational experience to work with Selenium. In the end, i've wrote all those links into a txt file and the Phenomenal works perfectly :))).    

> With an special thanks to my friend who is assigned me this breathtaking project. Thank you :)
